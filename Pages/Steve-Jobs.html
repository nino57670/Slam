    <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
    <p>Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 and led the creation of the Apple II and the Macintosh (1984), the first successful computer with a graphical interface. Forced out in 1985, he founded NeXT and bought Pixar, which later became a giant in animation. </p>

    <p>When Apple acquired NeXT in 1997, Jobs returned and saved Apple from near bankruptcy. He redefined the company with iconic products: iMac (1998), iTunes + iPod (2001), iPhone (2007), and iPad (2010), revolutionizing computers, music, phones, and tablets, and making Apple a global leader in innovation and design.</p>
