    <p>Apple Inc., formerly Apple Computer Inc., was founded on April 1, 1976, in Cupertino by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. In its early days, the company primarily specialized in manufacturing personal computers, notably the Apple II, Macintosh, and Power Mac lines.</p>

    <p>Despite difficult sales and a low market share in the 1990s, Steve Jobs resumed leadership of the company in 1997 after buying back his company NeXT. 
      He then introduced a new corporate philosophy focused on recognizable products and simple design, with notable successes such as the iMac, 
      the iPod digital music player, the iTunes music platform, and the Apple Store retail chain. In 2007, Apple dropped the term "Computer" from its commercial 
      name to focus on its consumer electronics products, and in 2020, it became the first private company in history to reach a market valuation of 2 trillion dollars.</p>
